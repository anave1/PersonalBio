      <h2>Motivation for Web Development</h2>
      <p id="cool">My reasoning for taking this course is to broaden my understanding of
        programming, which includes web programming. I am very satisfied with this
        course so far. I have already learned several new things about programming
        in general. Before this course I had not been exposed to HTML, CSS, or
        JavaScript. I am enjoying my time in this web development course and look
        forward to what we will learn next.</p>
